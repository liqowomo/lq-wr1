The permission 600 is a numeric representation of the file permissions in Unix-like systems. Each digit in the numeric representation represents a different set of permissions: the first digit represents the owner's permissions, the second digit represents the group's permissions, and the third digit represents others' (everyone else's) permissions.

In the case of 600, the permissions are as follows:

The owner of the file has read and write permissions (6):

4 represents read permission, allowing the owner to view the contents of the file.

2 represents write permission, allowing the owner to modify or delete the file.

The group and others have no permissions (0):

0 represents no permission, meaning that neither the group nor others can read, write, or execute the file.

So, when you set the permission of a file to 600, only the owner of the file has read and write access to it, while the group and others have no access at all.

This level of permission is useful for sensitive files, such as SSH private keys, as it ensures that only the owner can read and modify the file, providing a higher level of security.
